# Procurement Analytics Dashboard (Tableau)

## Overview
This repository contains an **interactive procurement analytics dashboard** developed as part of an **academic group project** for *INF20016 – Big Data Management* at Swinburne University.

The project analyses **2023–2024 procurement data** for a case-study company, *Velocipede Cycles*, with the goal of supporting **executive-level decision making** across cost savings, supplier risk, and procurement efficiency.

The final solution focuses on turning raw procurement data into **clear, actionable insights** through KPI-driven dashboards and intuitive interactivity.

> ⚠️ *Educational case study only — no real company or confidential data is used.*

## Project Objectives
- Establish a **baseline view of procurement performance** using executive KPIs  
- Identify **cost-saving opportunities** at product and supplier level  
- Assess **supplier concentration and dependency risks**  
- Improve dashboard **usability and clarity** for non-technical stakeholders  

---

## Dashboards Included
The Tableau dashboards are organised into three main analytical views:

1. **KPI Monitoring & Executive Overview**  
   - Total spend and year-on-year growth  
   - Average order value trends  
   - Supplier concentration and spend distribution  
   - Seasonal procurement patterns  

2. **Cost Savings Analysis** *(Primary focus of my contribution)*  
   - Potential savings by product (SKU)  
   - Price variance across suppliers  
   - Identification of high-impact negotiation targets  
   - Interactive filtering to isolate products, suppliers, and categories  

3. **Supplier Risk & Consolidation Analysis**  
   - Supplier dependency and concentration metrics  
   - Single-sourced product exposure  
   - Opportunities for supplier consolidation vs diversification

## My Contribution
This was a **group university project**. The original dashboard concept and overall structure were primarily designed by **Phuong Bao Minh Nguyen**.

My contributions focused on **extending the project beyond the original requirements**, particularly around usability and decision support:

- Designed **additional procurement KPIs** covering cost savings, supplier concentration, and risk exposure  
- Enhanced **dashboard UX** by adding interactive filters, drill-downs, and navigation elements  
- Significantly improved the **Cost Savings Analysis dashboard**, making insights more intuitive and executive-friendly  
- Refined dashboard layout and interactivity to better support **negotiation and strategic decision-making**  
- Learned **Tableau from scratch** and applied data visualisation and storytelling principles  

---

## Data Preparation & Quality
To ensure reliable insights, the project included structured data quality checks:

- Removal of duplicate transaction records  
- Referential integrity validation across procurement, product, supplier, and agent tables  
- Standardisation of column naming and identifier formats  
- Validation of value ranges, units of measure, and calculated fields  

A reproducible data preparation flow was used to support transparency and repeatability.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** – Dashboarding & interactivity  
- **SQL** – Data querying and aggregation  
- **Data Visualisation & Analytics**  
- **Procurement Analytics**  

---

## Key Learnings
- Effective analytics requires more than charts — **clarity, usability, and context** are critical  
- Dashboard interactivity plays a major role in supporting executive decision-making  
- Learning Tableau expanded my analytics skill set and encouraged **tool-agnostic thinking** about dashboard design  
- Comparing tools, I found **Power BI’s UX more intuitive for deep customisation**, but Tableau was a fun and valuable platform to learn
